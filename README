ystockquote is a Vala library which exposes APIs to get Stock data from Yahoo (finance.yahoo.com).

NOTE:
Yahoo stock update is not real time udpate. It is 15 minutes delayed (in India). So I am planning to suspend the development of this library as of now.

http://code.google.com/p/yahoo-finance-managed/wiki/YahooFinanceAPIs provides lot more info on Yahoo Finance API.

BUILD:

run build_lib.sh to build shared library from the Vala code.
